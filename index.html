      <h1>About the Project</h1>
      <div>Birds Beyond Borders is an inclusive and collaborative non-profit documentary and research project. Through the story of bird migration; the project aims to reveal more about climate change, our relationship with the natural world, and how we embrace wildlife as human society develops.</div>

      <h1>Birds Beyond Borders UK</h1>
      <p class="paragraph">In 2021, house martins and swifts were added to the red list of birds in the UK, one of the countries where they breed every spring.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">In the spring/summer of 2022 the Birds Beyond Borders UK team investigated the dramatic decline of these birds in Essex.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Along the Essex coast, however, a rewilding initiative launched by Sir David Attenborough has boosted the population of other red listed birds in the area. Here, the team set out to learn to learn more from Essex Wildlife Trust about rewilding, restoration and how connecting habitats is crucial for wildlife.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">The Birds Beyond Borders team have also filmed a number of other species across the UK that are being effected by the results of climate change like European bee-eater and dunlin.</p>

      <h1>Birds Beyond Borders Kenya</h1>
      <p class="paragraph">In the winters of November 2022 and November 2023 Kenyan filmmakers are setting out to capture the behaviour of migratory birds with the aim of revealing more about how global biodiversity networks operate. The team believe that following these birds&#x27; annual migration might be the key to revealing more about the global conservation efforts we need to see.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">The team hope to track these birds as they migrate back to Europe and investigate if their decline is ultimately down to climate change. Extreme shifts in weather patterns can affect the birds passage flights, ability to feed on the wing, or can push populations further North. Kenya, however, is one of the lowest emitters of greenhouse gasses; tackling this crisis will take a collective effort, especially from those in the West - which the documentary will highlight and explore. </p>
      <p class="paragraph">Birds beyond borders Kenya also aims to explore any local knowledge about these birds that may not have been recorded in western science - house martins, especially, have never been filmed in their wintering grounds.</p>
