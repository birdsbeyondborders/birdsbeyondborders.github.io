      <h1>Birds Beyond Borders UK</h1>
      <p class="paragraph">House martins and swifts were added to the red list of birds in 2021, in the UK, one of the countries where the birds breed every spring.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">In the spring/summer 2022 the Birds Beyond Borders UK team investigated the dramatic decline of these birds in Essex.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Along the Essex coast, however, a rewilding initiative launched by Sir David Attenborough has boosted the population of other species of red listed Paleartic birds. Here, the team set out to learn more about rewilding, restoration and how connecting habitats is crucial for red list species.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">The Birds Beyond Borders team have also filmed a number of other species across the UK that are being affected by the results of climate change like European bee-eater and dunlin.</p>

      <h1>Birds Beyond Borders Kenya</h1>
      <p class="paragraph">In the winter of 2022/2023 Kenyan naturalists and filmmakers are setting out to capture the behavior of Palearctic birds migration to help us understand how our global biodiversity networks operate. The team believe that following these birds&#x27; annual migration might be the key to revealing more about the global conservation efforts we need to see.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">The team hope to track these birds as they migrate back to Europe and investigate if their decline is ultimately down to climate change. Extreme shifts in weather patterns can affect the birds passage flights, ability to feed on the wing, or can push populations further North. Kenya, however, is one of the lowest emitters of greenhouse gasses; tackling this crisis will take a collective effort, especially from those in the West - which the documentary will highlight and explore. </p>
      <p class="paragraph">Birds beyond borders Kenya also aims to explore any local knowledge about these birds that may not have been recorded in western science - house martins, especially, have never been filmed in their wintering grounds.</p>
